NAME
  Finance::Bank::HSBC - Check your HSBC bank accounts from Perl

SYNOPSIS
  use Finance::Bank::HSBC;
  my @accounts = Finance::Bank::HSBC->check_balance(
      bankingid => "IBxxxxxxxxxx",
      seccode   => "xxxxxx"
  );

  foreach (@accounts) {
      printf "%25s : %13s / %18s : GBP %8.2f\n",
        $_->{name}, $_->{type}, $_->{account}, $_->{balance};
  }

DESCRIPTION
  This module provides a rudimentary interface to the HSBC online
  banking system at https://www.ebank.hsbc.co.uk/. 

DEPENDENCIES
  You will need either Crypt::SSLeay or IO::Socket::SSL installed 
  for HTTPS support to work with LWP.  This module also depends on 
  WWW::Mechanize and HTML::TokeParser for screen-scraping.

WARNING
  This warning is from Simon Cozens' Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB, and seems
  just as apt here.

  This is code for <online banking>, and that means <your money>, and
  that means <BE CAREFUL>. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit
  the source of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not
  doing anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful
  to me, but is provided under <NO GUARANTEE>, explicit or implied.
